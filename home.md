# research interests

I am deeply interested in exploring secure distributed systems and their practical applications, inspired by my work on ransomware defense algorithms that protected critical data at scale. I also enjoy delving into accessible web application development, aiming to create inclusive interfaces that align with my experience ensuring W3C compliance at UIC. Additionally, I am passionate about leveraging AI-driven innovations, such as those in my RhythPic project, to enhance user experiences in real-time systems.
